              About Me
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg  mb-6 font-serif">
              Hi, Iâ€™m Ankur Kumar, a motivated and enthusiastic software developer eager to kickstart my career in the tech industry. I recently graduated with a degree in <strong>BCA</strong> from <strong>Dr. Bhimrao Ambedkar University, Agra</strong>, where I gained hands-on experience in front-end and back-end development using technologies like <strong>React, HTML, Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS</strong>.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-6 font-serif">
              I am passionate about creating user-friendly, responsive applications and solving problems through code. My academic projects have allowed me to apply my skills in a real-world context, and I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg mb-6 font-serif">
              Outside of coding, I enjoy exploring new tech trends, reading about the latest developments in software, and working on personal projects to expand my knowledge.
